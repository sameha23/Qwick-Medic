-------------This is Qwikmedic Startup Project--------

In this File only contains the Project Setup

Now You Have to Implement other Pages.

It is necessary to know those before working:

1.First you have to carefully watch the Web view and the Mobile view on the figma.

2. Then follow the global.css file in project. In global.css file there is some common css and common color . YOU MUST HAVE TO USE THEM .

3.When you create a page , you have to create that in app folder.

4. Every folder will contain page's css file (page.css) and you have to write your page's custom css into there.

5.If you want to use any components for your page then you have to write them in that page folder (ex:About) inside that component folder

6.Feel free to explore google, stack overflow, chatgpt ... BUT NEVER USE CHATGPT'S CODE. THIS IS HARMFUL FOR YOU.

-----------HAPPY CODING-------------
